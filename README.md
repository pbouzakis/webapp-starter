# webapp-starter
Seed files for a new webapp.
Assumes you'd like to build your app using `gulp`, `npm`, and `browserify`.

## Sooooo... what do I do?

- Copy these files into your own project directory.
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- If app launches in a browser you are good to go!

### Next steps
- Probably should rename the `package.json` name field.
- The js source code is inside `lib`
- Styles are written in sass and live in the.. yup you guessed it, `styles` folder.
- Look inside the `index.html` and add more html. That would be good.
